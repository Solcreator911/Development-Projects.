# Development-Project
School and self projects.
These projects show my growth and my coding practices.
I show in these projects my hability to understand each theoretical foundation that JavaScript has.
From the basics if/else statments, for loops, arrays, to object oriented programming, etc...
Also my CSS3 advance in layout technique, grids, bootstrap.
